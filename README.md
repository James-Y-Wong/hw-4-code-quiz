## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build a code quiz using all the knowledge I gained during bootcamp. This project really tested my skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. With that, I was able to put together this functional project with my front-end skills.

## Result

The below pictures are the final result.

### Start Page

>This is the start page when the page loads. The user is able to view current highscores and/or start the quiz

### Quiz Page

>This page is where the actual quiz is. Once the "Start Quiz" button is clicked on the start page, the first question will populate and the timer will start. Answer is selected on click. Once a click is registered, it moves to the next question. Whether the answer is correct or wrong will be indicated. For every wrong answer, 10 seconds will be deducted from the timer.

### End Game Page

>Once the last question has been answered or the timer has reached 0, the end game page will show. This screen will show the user's final score which is what is left on the timer.
>- If final score is 0, there will be no option to enter initials and post to highscores. Only option is to go back to start page.
>- If final score is > 0, the user will have to input intials and submit to highscores.

### Highscores Page

>If "View Highscores" button on the start page or when "Submit" button on the end game page is clicked, it will bring the user to the highscores page. The high scores are stored in local storage and is sorted in order to render highest score first. There is an option to clear the highscores and/or return to start page.
